//! Threat-intelligence blocklist enforcement (per-cluster, off by default).
//!
//! Pulls the FireHOL Level 1 IP blocklist (high-confidence, low-
//! false-positive — known C2, well-attested offenders) and, when the
//! operator explicitly enables enforcement for a cluster, maintains
//! an `ipset` named `wolfstack_blocklist` plus iptables rules that
//! DROP traffic to/from those addresses.
//!
//! ## v23.2.2 safety model — off by default, three-state, per cluster
//!
//! Earlier versions (v23.2.0, v23.2.1) defaulted to **ENABLED** the
//! moment the binary started. Combined with thousands of operators
//! running wildly different network shapes (BGP peers in odd public
//! ranges, custom CGNAT, layer-2 overlays, hosts in private datacentre
//! /24s outside RFC1918), an opt-out posture was unsafe — any feed
//! false-positive or unexpected overlap would blackhole real traffic
//! before the operator knew the feature existed.
//!
//! v23.2.2 inverts that:
//!   * **Default**: `Off` for every cluster. No feed download, no
//!     ipset, no iptables rules, no analyzer noise other than an
//!     informational "this feature exists, here's how to try it"
//!     card.
//!   * **DryRun**: feed is fetched and parsed on every tick, the
//!     resulting blocklist + auto-allowlist + per-node overlap
//!     report is exposed to the operator, but the kernel ipset is
//!     never written and no iptables rules are installed. Operators
//!     can sit in DryRun for as long as they like to watch for false
//!     positives before committing.
//!   * **Enforce**: same as DryRun, plus the kernel ipset is built
//!     and iptables rules are installed. Promotion to Enforce
//!     requires a fresh (<5 min) preflight report and the operator
//!     typing the cluster name into the confirmation modal.
//!
//! State lives in `/etc/wolfstack/predictive-threat-intel.json`
//! keyed by cluster_name. Each node reads its own cluster's entry
//! every tick. State changes propagate to peers in the same cluster
//! via inter-node HTTP push (best-effort; peers that are offline
//! will pick up the new state via the gossip poll loop).
//!
//! ## Migration from v23.2.0 / v23.2.1
//!
//! On first boot of v23.2.2, every node:
//!   1. Removes any iptables INPUT/OUTPUT rules referencing the
//!      `wolfstack_blocklist` ipset and destroys the ipset itself.
//!   2. Removes the legacy auto-enable flag at
//!      `/var/lib/wolfstack/threat-intel/enabled`.
//!   3. Writes a sentinel at
//!      `/var/lib/wolfstack/threat-intel/migrated_v23_2_2` so the
//!      migration runs exactly once.
//!   4. Surfaces a `Medium` finding telling the operator what
//!      happened and how to re-enable safely.
//!
//! This is a deliberate, one-way reset. Operators who *did* want
//! enforcement on can re-enable cluster-by-cluster via the new UI.
//!
//! ## Why FireHOL Level 1
//!
//! Aggregates Spamhaus DROP/EDROP, dshield, abuse.ch trackers, and
//! a few others. Updated several times per day. Designed
//! specifically for "use this list for production filtering with
//! near-zero risk of blocking a legitimate user". Levels 2+ get
//! more aggressive but have correspondingly higher FP risk.
//!
//! ## Why ipset, not raw iptables
//!
//! ~30,000 entries. With one iptables rule per entry, packet
//! processing becomes O(N) per packet. `ipset` is a kernel
//! hash-table; lookup is effectively O(1). One iptables rule
//! referencing the set covers the entire list.
//!
//! ## What if ipset isn't installed?
//!
//! Detected at sample time. If `ipset` binary is missing and the
//! cluster is set to `Enforce`, the analyzer emits a `High` finding
//! (with a one-line install command) and skips actual blocking on
//! that host. It does NOT fall back to one-rule-per-IP iptables —
//! the performance hit would itself be a denial-of-service.
//!
//! ## Freshness
//!
//! Refreshed at most once per `REFRESH_INTERVAL`. The local cache
//! at `/var/lib/wolfstack/threat-intel/firehol_level1.netset` is
//! re-read on every tick (cheap) and the in-kernel ipset is
//! refreshed only when the file actually changed since the last
//! flush.
//!
//! ## Operator controls
//!
//! * REST: `POST /api/predictive/threat-intel/state` with body
//!   `{cluster, state, confirm}` — moves a named cluster between
//!   Off / DryRun / Enforce. Promoting to Enforce additionally
//!   requires a fresh preflight in the last 5 minutes.
//! * `/var/lib/wolfstack/threat-intel/allowlist.txt` — one CIDR per
//!   line, host-local override. These are never blocked even when
//!   present in the feed. Use sparingly.
