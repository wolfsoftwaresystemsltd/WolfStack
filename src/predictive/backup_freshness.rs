//! Backup freshness — Item 6 of the predictive plan.
//!
//! For every enabled `BackupSchedule` in `backup/mod.rs`, check
//! whether `last_run` is within the expected interval. If it isn't,
//! emit a finding so the operator knows their backup pipeline has
//! drifted before the next disaster makes it obvious.
//!
//! ## Severity tiers
//!
//! | Missed by                  | Severity   |
//! |----------------------------|------------|
//! | ≥ 7× interval              | `Critical` |
//! | ≥ 4× interval              | `High`     |
//! | ≥ 2× interval              | `Warn`     |
//! | < 2× interval              | suppressed |
//!
//! Examples:
//! - Daily schedule, last_run 30h ago → 1.25× interval → no finding
//! - Daily schedule, last_run 49h ago → 2.04× → Warn
//! - Daily schedule, last_run 5d ago → 5× → High
//! - Weekly schedule, last_run 60d ago → 8.5× → Critical
//!
//! ## Run OUTCOME — `backup_failed`
//!
//! Freshness alone is not enough, and the gap was not theoretical.
//! `last_run` is stamped even when every target in the run fails, so a
//! schedule that fails nightly looks perfectly fresh. On a live fleet
//! (2026-08-25) a full PBS datastore made every backup fail with
//! `Disk quota exceeded`; `last_run` kept updating on time, so this
//! analyzer stayed silent for **8 days** while the fleet had no backups
//! at all.
//!
//! The structured failure data was already available all along — the
//! same `BackupConfig` this module loads carries `entries[]` with a
//! per-target `status` and `error`. The `backup_failed` finding reads
//! the outcome of the most recent run and fires when targets in it
//! failed: `Critical` when the whole run failed (zero protection),
//! `High` when it partly failed.
//!
//! ## What this DOESN'T cover
//!
//! - Per-target backup *freshness* (only schedule level, plus the
//!   run-outcome counts above). A target silently dropped from a
//!   schedule stops being backed up without either finding firing.
