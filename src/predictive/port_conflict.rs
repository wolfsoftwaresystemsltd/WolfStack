//! Host-port collision and silent-publish-failure detector.
//!
//! Two failure modes this analyzer surfaces:
//!
//! 1. **Silent publish failure.** A Docker container's
//!    `HostConfig.PortBindings` requested a host port, but
//!    `NetworkSettings.Ports` shows the daemon never bound it. The
//!    container is running, but the URL the operator sent to their
//!    users is dead. This is the bug Klas hit after a reboot:
//!    compose project A grabbed the host port first, project B's
//!    container started anyway, and the Docker tab silently showed
//!    no ports for the second container. Severity: **High** — a
//!    user-visible service is offline and the operator wasn't told.
//!
//! 2. **Host-port collision detected.** Two or more owners want the
//!    same `(host_ip, host_port, proto)` tuple — could be two Docker
//!    containers (only one will actually bind), a Docker container
//!    plus a host process, or two host processes. We don't know
//!    which is "right"; we just report the collision so the operator
//!    can choose. Severity: **Warn**.
//!
//! Both findings auto-resolve when the underlying state clears (the
//! second container is rebuilt with a different port; the conflicting
//! host process is stopped). Scope keys include the host_ip+port+proto
//! tuple so `covered_scopes` can drive the resolver correctly.
