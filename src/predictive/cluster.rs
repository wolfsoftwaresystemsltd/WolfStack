//! Cluster-wide proposal aggregation.
//!
//! Each node's orchestrator produces proposals locally; this module
//! pulls them together so the Inbox UI shows findings from every
//! reachable peer at once. The data flow:
//!
//!   1. The dashboard hits `GET /api/proposals/cluster` on any node.
//!   2. That node consults a 30-second cache. On a miss, it fans out
//!      to every other online cluster peer's `/api/proposals` (using
//!      `X-WolfStack-Secret` for inter-node auth, with a 5 s
//!      per-peer timeout).
//!   3. Local proposals + per-peer results are merged into a single
//!      list, sorted Critical→Info / most-recent first.
//!   4. Per-peer status (responded / failed / unreachable) is
//!      surfaced so the UI can warn the operator if the Inbox is
//!      incomplete instead of silently showing partial data.
//!
//! ## Cache invalidation
//!
//! Every state-changing predictive endpoint (snooze, dismiss,
//! approve, run-now, ack create+delete) clears the cache. Operator
//! actions should produce immediate refreshes, not wait the 30 s
//! TTL.
//!
//! ## Why not push?
//!
//! A push model would have each node POST its proposals to a
//! "leader". That requires leader election and a sync protocol; pull
//! is consistent with the existing 10 s cluster polling pattern and
//! gracefully degrades when a peer is unreachable (just shows a
//! stale-data warning instead of hanging).
