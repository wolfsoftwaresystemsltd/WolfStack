//! Security posture findings — Item 8 + partial Convergence C.
//!
//! First analyzer in the predictive pipeline whose severity depends
//! on `NetworkReachability` — this is the consumer that the
//! reachability classifier was built for. Same shape of finding
//! that `security.rs::scan_listening_services` and `scan_sshd_config`
//! produce, but routed through the unified Inbox so operators get:
//! - Snooze / dismiss / ack-as-intentional semantics
//! - Cluster-aware aggregation
//! - First-appearance notification dispatch on Critical/High
//!
//! ## Findings
//!
//! - `service_bound_publicly` — a well-known risky service is
//!   listening on an interface reachable from the public internet
//!   (per `NetworkReachability`). Severity by service-class +
//!   reachability matrix.
//! - `sshd_password_auth_enabled` — sshd has
//!   `PasswordAuthentication yes`. Severity higher when sshd is
//!   reachable from the public internet.
//! - `sshd_root_login_enabled` — sshd has `PermitRootLogin yes`.
//!   Severity higher when sshd is reachable from the public
//!   internet.
//!
//! ## Convergence note
//!
//! `security.rs` keeps its active-attack scans (SSH brute-force,
//! crypto miners, /tmp binaries, outbound suspicious) for now —
//! those are event-detection at a different cadence and the
//! convergence shape is non-trivial (they're "things happening
//! right now", not "posture that should be true"). Migrating them
//! is a follow-up; the duplication on these three POSTURE findings
//! is what this delta retires.
