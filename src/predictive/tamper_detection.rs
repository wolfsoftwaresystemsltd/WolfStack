//! Baseline-driven tamper detection for SSH hardening, sudo, and
//! brute-force protection — the surfaces attackers tamper with to
//! establish persistence after the initial break-in.
//!
//! Complements `compromise_indicators` (which catches the literal
//! IoCs of the BootingWorld attack chain): this module catches the
//! *generic* post-exploitation moves an attacker makes regardless
//! of which specific kit they're running.
//!
//! ## Indicators
//!
//! * `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` drift — typically the attacker re-enables
//!   `PermitRootLogin yes` and `PasswordAuthentication yes` so they
//!   can keep brute-forcing or reuse a stolen password.
//! * `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` drift — the #1 SSH persistence
//!   vector: drop an attacker-controlled key, you're back in
//!   forever even after the operator changes the root password.
//! * `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/*` drift — attacker adds a
//!   non-root account with NOPASSWD ALL=(ALL) so they can re-escalate
//!   without needing the root password.
//! * `/etc/passwd` new UIDs with shell access that weren't in the
//!   baseline — backdoor accounts.
//! * `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` and `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/*` drift OR
//!   `fail2ban.service` is installed but stopped/masked — the
//!   defender's first move against persistent brute-forcers is the
//!   attacker's first move to disable.
//!
//! Auto-fixes are baseline-driven: when drift is detected the
//! current file is captured for forensics and the baseline content
//! is restored. The baseline itself was auto-seeded on first run
//! (so a fresh install doesn't false-positive) and can be re-seeded
//! via `/api/predictive/baselines/reseed/<name>` when the operator
//! makes an intentional change.
//!
//! ## When we DON'T auto-revert
//!
//! Reverting is destructive, so two rules bound it. Both exist
//! because the analyzer cannot tell an operator apart from an
//! attacker by file content alone, and a revert that fires every
//! 5-minute tick silently undoes legitimate work forever.
//!
//! 1. **One-shot per baseline anchor.** We revert a given file at
//!    most once; after that we detect and alert only, until the
//!    operator reseeds. See `baselines::autofix_already_applied`.
//!
//! 2. **Pure key additions to `authorized_keys` are never reverted.**
//!    Adding an SSH key is routine administration. Deleting the
//!    operator's newly-added key — repeatedly, with no visible
//!    cause — is a worse outcome than leaving an unreviewed key in
//!    place next to a Critical inbox card naming its fingerprint.
//!    Anything else in that file (a baselined key REMOVED or its
//!    blob changed, an options-carrying or malformed line added)
//!    is treated as tampering and reverted under rule 1. This
//!    mirrors the `/etc/passwd` safe-addition carve-out below,
//!    which exists for exactly the same reason.
//!
//! ## Why baselines, not "good values"
//!
//! We deliberately do NOT ship a "correct sshd_config". Operators
//! legitimately customize it (Port, AllowUsers, KexAlgorithms,
//! Ciphers, etc.) and overwriting with our opinion would break
//! their setup. Baselines capture what THIS host considers normal
//! and only flag departures from that.
