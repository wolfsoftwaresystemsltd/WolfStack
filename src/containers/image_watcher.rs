/// Sequence:
///   1. Refuse on passive policies (Ignore + Pinned) — the auto-loop
///      shouldn't reach here for those, but defense-in-depth keeps a
///      misuse from mutating a frozen container.
///   2. `docker inspect` captures the current config (image, ports,
///      volumes, env, restart policy, etc.) and the old image ID for
///      rollback.
///   3. Optional pre-update backup via `backup::backup_docker`. Backup
///      failures ABORT the update — better to leave the container
///      running on the old image than apply without a rollback path.
///   4. `docker pull <image>`; we then snapshot the new image ID.
///   5. If the pull didn't change the local image (no-op), record
///      Completed without recreating.
///   6. `docker stop` + `docker rm` + recreate-from-inspect — the
///      tag's now pointing at the new image so recreate naturally
///      picks it up.
///   7. Health check (if enabled): poll docker inspect for HEALTHCHECK
