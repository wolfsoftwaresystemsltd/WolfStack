//! WolfHA replication drivers — how a delta actually gets computed.
//!
//! WolfHA Phase 1 had exactly one strategy: walk the container rootfs,
//! build a per-file manifest, diff it against the replica's, and tar the
//! changed paths. That is incremental at *file* granularity, which is
//! fine for a rootfs of small files and badly wrong for a 10 GB database
//! file that took a 4 KB write — the whole file ships every round. It
//! also cannot replicate a VM at all: a qcow2 is one enormous file, so
//! "the file changed" degenerates to "send the disk", and copying a
//! running VM's disk at file level produces a torn image (which
//! `vms::manager` already refuses to do for exactly this reason).
//!
//! The fix is not to pick a better single algorithm. WolfStack runs on
//! thousands of machines whose storage we do not get to choose, so
//! replication is split into two INDEPENDENT axes:
//!
//! - **Transport** ([`DriverKind`]) — how the bytes travel. Negotiated
//!   with the replica, because both ends must understand the payload.
//! - **Consistency** ([`ConsistencySource`]) — what the bytes are read
//!   FROM. Purely a property of the primary's storage, so it is not
//!   negotiated at all: the replica cannot tell whether a file was read
//!   from the live rootfs or from a snapshot of it, and does not need to.
//!
//! Keeping them separate is what makes snapshots usable in the general
//! case. Using `zfs send` as a *transport* would demand the replica also
//! run ZFS with a matching snapshot — storage we do not control. Using a
//! snapshot as a *source* demands nothing of the replica, works with any
//! transport, and still buys the thing that actually matters: the copy is
//! taken at one instant, so the replica is crash-consistent instead of
//! holding a half-written database.
//!
//! The operator never picks either axis — they cannot be expected to know
//! whether their workload is "many small files" or "few huge ones", and on
//! a mixed fleet the right answer differs per node anyway.
//!
//! The bottom rung, [`DriverKind::FileManifest`], is the Phase 1
//! behaviour and is always available. Anything that fails to negotiate
//! lands there, which is what makes this safe to ship to existing
//! installs: a replica running an older build has no capabilities
//! endpoint, the probe fails, and both ends carry on doing exactly what
//! they did before.
