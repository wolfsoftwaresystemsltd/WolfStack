//! WolfHA — manual high availability for native LXC containers (Phase 1).
//!
//! Model: the container runs on ONE node (the primary). Each chosen
//! replica node holds a stopped copy with the SAME name, MAC, IP and
//! WolfNet marker — on a shared-L2 bridge (vSwitch) the copy can take
//! over the identity wholesale, so DNS never changes and no load
//! balancer is needed. The primary pushes incremental rootfs deltas to
//! every replica on a schedule (manifest diff over the agent HTTP
//! channel — no SSH provisioning). Failover and failback are OPERATOR
//! actions in this phase: promotion is a human decision, so the
//! split-brain class of automatic-failover bugs cannot occur.
//!
//! Replica hygiene rules (the difference between HA and self-inflicted
//! split-brain):
//! - replicas carry a `.wolfha-replica` marker and NEVER have
//!   `lxc.start.auto` — `lxc-autostart` at boot cannot start them;
//! - the PRIMARY's autostart flag is taken over by WolfHA
//!   (`autostart_managed`): stripped from the config and re-applied as
//!   a boot-time start that first asks every replica "did you take
//!   over while I was down?" (see [`boot_guard`]);
//! - after a failover the old primary's copy is marked stale and is
//!   only reused after a reverse sync (failback = promote on the
//!   original node once it has caught up).
//!
//! Phase 1 scope: native LXC on native nodes only (Proxmox-managed
//! containers have LVM/ZFS-backed rootfs that isn't a stable host dir).

//    can ping the configured witness IP (normally the gateway). A
//    partitioned node fails the ping and does nothing.
// 2. PRIORITY — the ordered replica list is the succession order. A
//    standby defers to any healthier standby listed before it.
// 3. THE BRIDGE ITSELF — before promoting, a standby pings the
//    container's own IP on the shared L2. If ANYTHING answers, the
//    container is alive somewhere and promotion aborts. On a shared
//    vSwitch the resource is its own lock.
//
// Timing contract: the primary self-fences after failover_after/2 (min
// 30s) of witness loss; standbys promote only after the FULL
// failover_after of primary unreachability — so on a clean partition
// the incumbent is stopped well before any standby starts.
