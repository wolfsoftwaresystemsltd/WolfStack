//! WolfRouter — native router/firewall/DHCP/DNS module.
//!
//! Replaces the OPNsense-in-a-VM pattern with a host-native stack built
//! on iptables (filter table for stateful rules, already-wired `nat`
//! table for DNAT/SNAT) plus dnsmasq (per-LAN DHCP + DNS).
//!
//! Three user-visible concepts:
//!   • **Zone** — named policy group (`Wan`, `Lan(N)`, `Dmz`, `Wolfnet`,
//!     `Trusted`, `Custom`). Every interface/bridge/VLAN gets a zone.
//!     Rules talk about zones, not interfaces.
//!   • **LAN segment** — a subnet served by WolfRouter. Bound to a
//!     bridge or interface; dnsmasq hands out DHCP leases and answers
//!     DNS with upstream forwarders.
//!   • **Firewall rule** — zone-to-zone or specific-endpoint allow/deny
//!     with state tracking. Translated to iptables atomically via
//!     `iptables-restore --test` then swap.
//!
//! All state persists to `/etc/wolfstack/router/` as JSON so it survives
//! restarts. Topology (live view of ports/bridges/wires/devices) is
//! computed on demand from system state — never persisted.

/// the SAME box's `/etc/network/interfaces` LAN stanza. ifup
/// installed `default via 10.10.10.1 dev ens1 proto static` (metric
