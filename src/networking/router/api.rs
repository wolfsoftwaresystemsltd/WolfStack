//! REST endpoints for WolfRouter. Mounted under `/api/router/*`.
//!
//! Cluster model:
//!   • **Read endpoints** (topology, leases, rules, segments) aggregate
//!     from all cluster nodes. The master node fans out per-node queries
//!     via the existing cluster-secret RPC.
//!   • **Write endpoints** (create/update/delete rule or segment) persist
//!     to config on the owning node. If the edit targets a remote node,
//!     the master proxies the call via the existing `/api/nodes/{id}/proxy`
//!     machinery.

// WolfRouter is per-cluster. Every list endpoint that returns config
// items must filter by the active cluster — otherwise a bastion with
// (say) 5 clusters / 14 servers shows every cluster's LANs / rules /
// WANs / proxies / zones in every cluster's WolfRouter view, which
// is a real cross-cluster leak (Adam Cogswell 2026-04-29: "the user
// should NEVER EVER see anything from another cluster in wolfrouter
// they are on distinct networks").
//
// `cluster_node_id_set` returns the set of node IDs that belong to
// the requested cluster (None = no filter, return everything). Each
// list endpoint then keeps items whose `node_id` is in that set
// (plus optionally items with `node_id = None`, which apply globally
// and are inherently cluster-agnostic).
