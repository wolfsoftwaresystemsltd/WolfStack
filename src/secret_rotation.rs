//! Stage 3 of the cluster-secret migration: operator-initiated,
//! coordinated rotation of the cluster secret across every peer in
//! the local cluster.
//!
//! The protocol is split into five operator-controllable steps so that
//! a failed peer never leaves the cluster in a half-rotated state:
//!
//!   1. **Preflight** — initiator pings every peer (using the CURRENT
//!      cluster secret to authenticate) and confirms each one is
//!      reachable AND on a build that understands the protocol.
//!      Returns a per-peer reachability report. NOTHING IS WRITTEN.
//!
//!   2. **Propose** — initiator generates a fresh per-install secret
//!      (32 bytes from /dev/urandom). Returns the value to the operator
//!      UI for display + copy-to-clipboard, and stashes it in a pending
//!      file on the initiator. NOTHING IS PUSHED TO PEERS.
//!
//!   3. **Receive** — initiator pushes the pending secret to every
//!      peer's `/api/cluster/secret/rotate-receive`, authenticating
//!      with the CURRENT secret (still valid on every peer). Each
//!      peer writes the new secret to a `.pending` sibling of its
//!      active secret file. Each peer returns an ACK with the SHA-256
//!      fingerprint so the initiator can confirm bit-for-bit transfer.
//!
//!   4. **Commit** — if every peer ACK'd Receive, initiator broadcasts
//!      `/rotate-commit`. Each peer atomically promotes its .pending
//!      to the active path, backing up the prior active file to a
//!      timestamped `.bak.<ts>` first. The peer's in-memory cluster
//!      secret is NOT live-swapped (would race with concurrent
//!      requests). Both the old in-memory value AND the new on-disk
//!      value remain accepted by `require_auth` until the next restart,
//!      so the cluster works in "mixed" mode during the rolling
//!      restart that follows.
//!
//!   5. **Rollback** — if any peer fails at any step, initiator
//!      broadcasts `/rotate-rollback`. Each peer either deletes its
//!      .pending (if not yet committed) or restores from its .bak
//!      (if committed). The .bak file is the recovery anchor; we
//!      never overwrite or delete it during normal flow.
//!
//! Every step appends a structured line to
//! `/var/log/wolfstack/secret-rotation.log` (mode 0600). The log is
//! the forensic trail for "why did rotation N go weird".
//!
//! ## Why no live in-memory swap
//!
//! `state.cluster_secret` is read by 50+ outbound call sites and 3+
//! auth check sites. Hot-swapping it under an RwLock would (a) require
//! changing the type from `String` to `Arc<RwLock<String>>` everywhere
//! and (b) introduce a race window where some calls are signed with
//! the new secret before all peers have it accepted. The restart-
//! required model is operationally identical to other infrastructure
//! tools (Consul, etcd: SIGHUP-or-restart; Vault: rekey requires
//! restart of standby nodes) and reuses an existing safety net:
//! `api::require_auth` already accepts BOTH the in-memory secret AND
//! `auth::load_cluster_secret()` (re-reads disk on every call). So
//! the post-commit / pre-restart window is auth-tolerant by design.
