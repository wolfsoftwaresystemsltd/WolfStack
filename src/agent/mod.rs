// cluster-name heal sweep (added by 85e3553a for fleets joined before
// C1-Fix-2). Do not reintroduce it.
//
// It read THIS node's `nodes.json` record for each peer and POSTed that
// name to the peer's `/api/agent/cluster-name` every 30 minutes. Two
// things make that wrong:
//
//  1. Our `cluster_name` for a peer is a MIRROR, not a command. The
//     gossip merge in `poll_remote_nodes` syncs it *from* whatever peers
//     report (`eff_cluster = known.cluster_name`) and only holds a local
//     value while an identity intent is open. The sweep took that mirror
//     and re-broadcast it as an instruction, so every node asserted every
//     other node's identity with no record that an operator asked for it.
//
//  2. Its "fundamentally one-shot, idempotent" premise only holds if the
//     name never legitimately changes. Once it does, the sweep re-asserts
//     the stale value and UNDOES the correction.
//
// Observed 2026-07-28 (Wolf Territories): wolfstack-1 adopted a region
// cluster's name via the weak-IP gossip bug fixed in v25.5.4, self-reported
// it, and five peers faithfully mirrored it. v25.5.4 stopped the adoption
// but the stale value was already replicated, and this sweep pushed it back
// from four nodes at once — wolfstack-1 reverted within three minutes of
// every manual correction.
//
// Cluster/display identity now travels ONLY through the identity-intent
// queue below: an operator edit records an intent, `sweep_identity_intents`
// re-pushes until the owner confirms, then clears it. One authority, and a
// deliberate operator action behind every change.

// ─── Identity-intent queue (reliable rename / move propagation) ──────
//
// An operator rename (display_name) or move (cluster_name) made on the admin
// node must reach the OWNING node — only its own self-report is authoritative,
// so until the owner adopts the value, the next poll would revert it. We push
// synchronously on edit, but the owner may be offline or briefly unreachable;
// `pending_identity.json` records the intended value (keyed by the node's
// local id) and `sweep_identity_intents` re-pushes every cycle until the
// owner's self-report confirms it, then clears the intent. This is what makes
// "rename an offline node, it applies when it reconnects" work, and stops a
// gossip race from reverting an applied edit.

/// One node's pending identity edit. A field set to `Some` is what we want
/// the owner to end up with (`display_name: Some("")` means "clear the
/// override"); `None` means "no intent for this field".
