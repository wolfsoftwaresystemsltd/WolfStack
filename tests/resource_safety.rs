//! Build-time enforcement of the resource rules WolfStack must never break.
//!
//! WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//!
//! On 2026-08-05 a production fleet of twelve nodes melted down. Every node
//! climbed to 60-80% system CPU, descriptors grew ~700/min until the table was
//! exhausted at 65,535, and restarting bought only minutes. Workloads survived
//! only because systemd's `KillMode=process` kept guests out of the blast.
//!
//! Two defects, both invisible in review and both trivially preventable:
//!
//!   1. `POLL_CLIENT` — the client that dials EVERY cluster peer every 10
//!      seconds — set a total `.timeout()` but no `.connect_timeout()`. A total
//!      timeout does nothing for a connection that never establishes: a SYN to
//!      a black-holed address holds a descriptor for the kernel's full retry
//!      window (~130s at tcp_syn_retries=6). Measured: 2,422 sockets in
//!      SYN-SENT and 2,868 in CLOSE-WAIT on one node.
//!
//!   2. `SystemMonitor` refreshed ALL processes on a timer and at construction.
//!      sysinfo caches an open `/proc/<pid>/stat` handle per process and grants
//!      itself HALF of RLIMIT_NOFILE to do it — 32,767 descriptors claimed
//!      before a single metric was read.
//!
//! A management plane must not be capable of taking down the estate it
//! manages. These are not style preferences; they are the difference between a
//! bug and an outage.
//!
//! HOW THIS IS ACTUALLY ENFORCED
//!
//! By the "Resource-safety gate + test suite" step in
//! `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs `cargo test --locked` on the
//! x86_64 leg before the cross builds. That step was added at the same time as
//! this file — and had to be, because the release workflow previously ran only
//! `cargo check`, which compiles without executing a single test. Every rule
//! in here would have been advisory.
//!
//! If that step is ever removed, this file stops enforcing anything and
//! silently becomes documentation. The two must live or die together.
//!
//! ADDING AN EXCEPTION
//!
//! Put the file in the relevant allowlist below WITH a reason. An allowlist
//! entry is a deliberate, reviewable decision. Deleting the check is not.
